## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Development Workflow Commands
```bash
# Development (ALWAYS use air for development)
air              # Start development server with hot reload + auto-regeneration
make dev         # Alternative: calls air with startup message
make generate    # Manual generate (air does this automatically)
make build       # Build production binary

# Database
make migrate      # Run database migrations
make migrate-down # Rollback migrations
make seed         # Seed with sample data

# Testing & Quality
make test         # Run Go tests
make lint         # Run linter
make e2e          # Run Playwright tests

# Frontend
make css          # Compile Tailwind CSS
make images       # Optimize images

# Deployment
make deploy       # Deploy to Vercel
```

### Key Technology Decisions
- **Backend**: Go 1.25 + Echo v4.13+ for high performance
- **Database**: SQLite with modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, no CGO)
- **Templates**: Templ for type-safe server-side rendering
- **Frontend**: Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS v4 for progressive enhancement
- **Deployment**: Vercel serverless with automatic Git deployments
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Go testing for unit tests

## 📋 Session Planning & Progress Tracking

### Current Session (2025-09-03)
- [x] Project analysis and planning
- [x] Reference project examination  
- [x] PLAN.md creation
- [x] Complete foundation setup with Air-based development workflow
- [ ] **Next**: Frontend tooling setup

**⚠️ Important Development Note:**
- **ALWAYS use `air` for development** (never `go run` or `make run`)
- Air automatically handles code regeneration via pre_cmd in .air.toml
- This prevents forgetting to regenerate templates, SQLC code, etc.
