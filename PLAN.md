## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Development Workflow Commands

```bash
# Development (ALWAYS use air for development)
air              # Start development server with hot reload + auto-regeneration
make dev         # Alternative: calls air with startup message
make generate    # Manual generate (air does this automatically)
make build       # Build production binary

# Database
make migrate      # Run database migrations
make migrate-down # Rollback migrations
make seed         # Seed with sample data

# Testing & Quality
make test         # Run Go tests
make lint         # Run linter
make e2e          # Run Playwright tests

# Frontend
make css          # Compile Tailwind CSS
make images       # Optimize images

# Deployment
make deploy       # Deploy to Vercel
```

### Key Technology Decisions
